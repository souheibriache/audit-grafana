    question: "What is P10 and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "P10 (Position 10) is an innovative Formula 1 betting system where you predict which driver will finish in 10th position during a Grand Prix. This unique approach adds an exciting strategic element to race watching, as the 10th position is often highly contested and can be influenced by various race factors like pit stops, tire strategies, and race incidents. You can place your prediction before the race starts and track it in real-time during the event.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the P10 betting system work in detail?",
    answer:
      "The P10 betting system allows you to make one prediction per race for the 10th position finisher. You can place your bet anytime before the race start time, and you can modify your prediction until the race begins. Once the race starts, all predictions are locked. The system updates in real-time during the race, allowing you to track how your prediction is performing. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of your prediction, with bonus points for perfect predictions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are points calculated for P10 predictions?",
    answer:
      "Points are awarded based on how close your prediction is to the actual 10th position. A perfect prediction (correctly identifying the 10th place finisher) earns the maximum points. If your prediction is off, points decrease based on how many positions your prediction was off from the actual result. For example, if you predicted a driver to finish 10th but they finished 11th, you'll still earn points, just fewer than a perfect prediction. The exact point system is designed to reward both accuracy and strategic thinking.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are leagues and how do they work?",
    answer:
      "Leagues are competitive groups where you can compete with other P10 users. You have two options: create a private league to play exclusively with friends, or join public leagues to compete with the wider community. You can participate in multiple leagues simultaneously, each with its own leaderboard. This allows you to track your performance across different groups and compete at various levels. Leagues add a social and competitive element to the P10 experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I improve my P10 predictions?",
    answer:
      "To improve your P10 predictions, consider these factors: 1) Driver and team form in recent races, 2) Track characteristics and historical performance, 3) Qualifying results and starting positions, 4) Team strategies and tire choices, 5) Weather conditions and their impact. The 10th position is often contested by multiple drivers, so analyzing these factors can help you make more informed predictions. You can also learn from your past predictions and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a race is affected by weather or incidents?",
    answer:
      "The P10 system takes into account all race conditions and incidents. If a race is red-flagged or affected by weather conditions, the final classification at the end of the race (including any penalties or time adjustments) will be used to determine the 10th position. This ensures fair play regardless of race circumstances. In case of a race cancellation, all predictions for that race will be voided and no points will be awarded.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track my betting history and performance?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can access your complete betting history and performance statistics through your profile. This includes your past predictions, points earned, success rate, and ranking in different leagues. The system provides detailed analytics to help you understand your betting patterns and improve your strategy over time. You can also compare your performance with other users in your leagues.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any betting limits or restrictions?",
    answer:
      "You can place one bet per race, and you must submit your prediction before the race start time. There are no monetary bets involved - the system is purely based on points and competition. The only restriction is that you cannot modify your prediction once the race has started. This ensures fair play and maintains the competitive integrity of the system.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I join or create a league?",
    answer:
      "To join a league, you can browse available public leagues or accept invitations to private leagues. To create a league, go to the 'Leagues' section and select 'Create New League'. You can set up a private league by inviting specific users, or create a public league that anyone can join. As a league creator, you can set custom rules and manage league members. You can participate in multiple leagues simultaneously to maximize your competitive experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes P10 different from traditional F1 betting?",
    answer:
      "P10 offers a unique approach to Formula 1 engagement by focusing specifically on the 10th position. This creates an exciting middle-ground competition that's often more unpredictable than podium positions. Unlike traditional betting, P10 is free to play and focuses on skill and knowledge rather than financial stakes. The system encourages strategic thinking and deep understanding of F1 racing, making it both educational and entertaining for fans of all levels.",
